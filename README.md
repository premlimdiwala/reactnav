### **Features and Components Breakdown:**
1. **Responsive Navigation:** The `Header` component provides navigation between different tabs (Home, Menu, Blog, Contact, Login). The active tab is highlighted based on the `activetab` state.
2. **Dynamic Theme Switching:** The `ThemeToggle` component allows users to switch between light and dark modes. The app uses inline styles to update background and text colors accordingly.
3. **Blog Posts:** The `Blog` component displays a list of posts with titles, authors, and content. The blog content is hardcoded in the state.
4. **Contact Form:** The `Contact` component contains a form to collect the user's name, email, and message, which is logged on form submission.
5. **Login & Signup:** The `Login` component provides a login/signup form, where users can toggle between the two forms using the `isSignup` state.
6. **Content Pages:** Each page (Home, Menu, Blog, Contact, Login) has specific styles and displays information relevant to that page.
7. **Interactive UI Elements:** The navigation items change color when clicked, and buttons have hover effects.

### **Installation and Usage:**
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application locally with `npm start`.

This should start the application at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### **Future Improvements:**
- **Routing:** Implement `react-router` for better navigation between pages (rather than conditionally rendering based on active tab).
- **Backend Integration:** Implement actual backend services to handle form submissions and authentication.
- **State Management:** Use `context API` or `redux` for global state management instead of passing props.
